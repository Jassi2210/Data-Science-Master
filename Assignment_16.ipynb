        "Ans1. MongoDB is a popular document-oriented, NoSQL database management system. In contrast to traditional relational databases that store data in rows and columns, MongoDB stores data in JSON-like documents with dynamic schemas. This makes it highly scalable, flexible, and well-suited to handling large amounts of unstructured or semi-structured data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Non-relational databases, also known as NoSQL databases, are a category of databases that do not use the traditional relational model of tables and rows. Instead, they use flexible data models, including document-based, key-value, graph, and column-family databases. NoSQL databases are designed to handle the challenges of big data, such as high data volume, high data velocity, and data variety. They can scale horizontally, meaning they can add more nodes to a cluster to increase capacity and performance, and can handle unstructured data formats such as images, videos, and JSON.\n",

        "\n",
        "1.Flexibility: MongoDB has a flexible document-based data model that can accommodate changes in the data structure without requiring schema modifications. This is particularly useful in scenarios where the data structure is not well-defined, or when it is expected to change frequently.\n",

        "2.Scalability: MongoDB is designed to scale horizontally, meaning it can handle large amounts of data by adding more nodes to a cluster. This is useful in scenarios where there is a need to store and manage large amounts of unstructured data.\n",
